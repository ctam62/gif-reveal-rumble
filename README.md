* Use HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox & Sass for structuring and building the UI
* Use appropriate BEM naming convention
* Use DOM APIs for adding/deleting/updating the elements on your page
* Use the fundamentals of programming in Javascript to write your logic. This would entail usage of variables, control flow statements, functions, loops & DOM APIs
* Demonstrate implementation of asynchronous programming concepts like promises, callbacks, event handlers
* Pick an API from the list below for your project and apply your asynchronous programming skills to call the required API in your project
* Optional: use CSS animations, responsive design, external font libraries for a better UI

## Game Rules
